# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio. This repository showcases a selection of self-directed projects I completed as part of my graduate coursework, using tools such as Python, SQL, Excel, and modeling techniques including regression, classification, simulation, and visualization. Each project is housed in its own folder and includes a detailed README.

## üìä Projects Overview

### 1. [NBA Player Evaluation](./nba-player-evaluation)
**Tools:** Python (pandas, seaborn, XGBoost), Jupyter Notebook  
**Focus:** Regression, classification, interpolation  
**Objective:** Identify high-performing NBA players with relatively low salaries to help teams build winning, balanced rosters under a salary cap.

Key techniques:
- Linear regression with log transformation and outlier handling
- XGBoost classification to identify undervalued players
- Linear interpolation to estimate salary value from performance

### 2. [Olympic Participants Analysis](./olympic-participants)
**Tools:** SQL, Python, Google Colab  
**Focus:** Gender representation, international participation, medal trends  
**Objective:** Explore the evolution of female athlete participation and performance in the Olympics over time.

Key techniques:
- SQL queries to generate summary data by gender, country, and medal status
- Visualizations using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib
- Comparative analysis of medal share and gender ratios by country

### 3. [Cost-Benefit Analysis of Dam Projects](./cost-benefit-analysis)
**Tools:** Excel (Monte Carlo simulation, statistical testing)  
**Focus:** Simulation, risk analysis, economic modeling  
**Objective:** Determine which of two proposed dam locations offers the highest community benefit based on uncertain cost and benefit inputs.

Key techniques:
- Triangular distributions to simulate variability
- 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulation
- Cost-benefit ratio calculations and Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit testing
