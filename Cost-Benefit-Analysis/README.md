# 💰 Maximizing Profit: Dam Site Cost-Benefit Analysis

**`cost-benefit-analysis.xlsx`** is an analytics project developed as part of graduate coursework. The analysis uses simulation techniques and statistical modeling to select the most economically advantageous dam site between two proposed locations.

---

## ❓ Project Question

> **Which proposed dam site will have a greater positive impact on the surrounding community?**

The analysis compares projected **annual benefits and costs** across multiple categories for each location. It calculates a **benefit-cost ratio (BCR)** to evaluate and compare the two dam sites.

---

## 📊 Analysis Summary

Each site was evaluated based on:

### ✅ Benefits (in $ millions)
- Improved navigation  
- Hydroelectric power  
- Fish and wildlife  
- Recreation  
- Flood control  
- Commercial development  

### ✅ Costs (in $ millions)
- Annualized capital cost  
- Operations and maintenance  

The **total benefit** is divided by the **total cost** to compute a **benefit-cost ratio (BCR)**, which is then used to compare the two options.

## ⚙️ Methods and Models

- 📐 **Triangular distribution** used to estimate:
  - Average cost
  - Average benefit
  - Average cost-benefit ratio for each dam

- 🔁 **Monte Carlo Simulation**:
  - 10,000 simulations per site
  - Captures a wide range of possible benefit/cost outcomes across the 8 categories

- 📊 **Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit**:
  - Used to assess whether the simulated output matches expected theoretical distributions

## 🔍 Key Insight

This analysis supports data-driven decision-making by quantifying uncertainty in both cost and benefit estimates. It helps determine which dam location is more likely to yield greater economic value to the community.
